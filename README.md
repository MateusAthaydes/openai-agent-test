### **OpenAI Function Calling**
The AI agent is equipped with 5 powerful tools:
- `get_locations` - Fetch all medical office locations
- `get_clinicians` - Get doctors by location and specialty
- `check_availability` - Real-time appointment slot checking
- `create_patient` - Save patient information to EHR
- `create_appointment` - Book confirmed appointments

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo>
   cd openai-agent-test
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your OpenAI API key to .env
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" >> .env
   ```

3. **Start the servers**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start the EHR mock server + Web interface
   npm run server
   
   # Terminal 2 (optional): CLI version
   npm run text-to-text
   ```

4. **Open the web interface**
   ```
   http://localhost:3001
   ```

## Usage

### Web Interface
1. Visit `http://localhost:3001`
2. Select "Text to Text" experience
3. Click "Start Text Chat"
4. **Watch the magic happen**: Real-time logs on the left show exactly what the AI is doing!
5. Ask the AI about:
   - "What locations do you have?"
   - "Show me doctors in Brooklyn"
   - "I need to schedule an appointment"
   - "Check availability for Dr. Sarah Johnson next Tuesday"

**Pro tip**: Toggle the log panel with the logs button to focus on the chat or see both sides!

### CLI Interface
```bash
npm run text-to-text
> What locations are available?
> I need to book an appointment with a cardiologist
```

## **Real-Time System Logs**

The web interface features a live log panel that shows exactly what's happening behind the scenes:

### **What You'll See:**
- **HTTP Requests**: Every GET, POST request with headers, body, and response details
- **EHR API Calls**: Watch the AI fetch locations, doctors, and availability in real-time
- **OpenAI Function Calls**: See which tools the AI decides to use and when
- **Data Operations**: Live view of patient records and appointments being created
- **WebSocket Events**: Connection status and real-time communication
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, data sizes, and operation success/failure
- **Database Operations**: See clinicians filtered by location, availability checks
- **Server Lifecycle**: Startup, initialization, and configuration events

### **Log Categories:**
- `HTTP` - All incoming requests and outgoing responses
- `CHAT` - User messages and conversation flow
- `AI_AGENT` - OpenAI processing and responses  
- `EHR_API` - Database operations and API calls
- `CLINICIANS` - Doctor lookup and filtering operations
- `LOCATIONS` - Medical facility operations
- `AVAILABILITY` - Schedule and time slot operations
- `WEBSOCKET` - Real-time connection events
- `SESSION` - User session management
- `SERVER` - System startup and configuration
- `DATABASE` - Data initialization and mock setup

### **Controls:**
- **Toggle Button**: Hide/show log panel (header button)
- **Clear Button**: Reset logs while keeping system running
- **Auto-scroll**: Always shows latest activity
- **Color Coding**: Green=Success, Blue=Info, Orange=Warning, Red=Error

Perfect for demos, debugging, and understanding how AI agents really work!

AI: Great choice! Let me show you the doctors available at Brooklyn Family Practice...
    
    [AI calls get_clinicians tool with location filter]
    
    At Brooklyn Family Practice, we have:
    • Dr. Lisa Thompson - Family Medicine
    
    Would you like to see Dr. Thompson's availability?
```

### Checking Availability
```
User: What times does Dr. Sarah Johnson have available next Monday?
AI: Let me check Dr. Sarah Johnson's availability for Monday...
    
    [AI calls check_availability tool]
    
    Dr. Sarah Johnson has these available slots on 2024-01-15:
    • 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM
    • 10:30 AM - 11:00 AM  
    • 2:00 PM - 2:30 PM
